# Network Packet Sniffer

## Project Description
This project is part of my cybersecurity internship(Minor Project–1) 
The objective of this project is to understand how network packet sniffing works by building a simple packet sniffer using Python and the Scapy library.  
The project captures live network packets and displays basic information such as source IP, destination IP, and protocol.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scapy (Python library)
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code
- Wireshark

## Work Done – Day 1 (Setup & Environment Configuration)
On Day 1, I focused on setting up the complete development environment and linking the project to GitHub.

### Steps performed:
- Installed Python for writing the packet sniffer program
- Installed Git for version control
- Installed VS Code as the code editor
- Installed Wireshark for network packet analysis and verification
- Created a GitHub account and a public repository named `hh8-minor-project-1`
- Created the project folder locally and opened it in VS Code
- Initialized Git in the project folder using: `git init`
- Configured Git username and email
- Connected the local project to the GitHub repository
- Verified GitHub–VS Code connection

No coding was done on Day 1.  
The focus was on proper setup so that development and commits could be done smoothly in the following days.

## Work Done – Day 2 (Packet Sniffer Implementation)
- Installed and verified the Scapy library
- Fixed Python execution issues on Windows
- Developed a Python-based packet sniffer using Scapy
- Captured live network packets
- Displayed source IP, destination IP, and protocol (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
- Successfully ran the program and observed real packet output
- Committed and pushed the working code to GitHub

## How to Run the Project
1. Install Python and Scapy
2. Clone the repository
3. Run the program using: `python sniffer_ip.py`

## What I Learned
- Basics of network packet sniffing
- Understanding IP addresses and protocols
- Using Scapy for packet capture
- Using Git and GitHub for version control
- Importance of proper environment setup
- Basic usage of Wireshark for packet analysis
